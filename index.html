</p><h2><b>About me:</b></h2>
</center>
<div class="paragraph">

	  I am a second year Ph.D. student in the School of Information at the University of Michigan where I am advised by <a href="https://azjacobs.com/">Abigail Jacobs</a>.   Broadly speaking, I am interested in governance of sociotechnical systems. Recently, I am interested in understanding where technosolutionists get their politcs from. I am currently working on a project investigating the relationship between the US military and the 1960s Bay Area countercultural movement as the two came together at Stanford during the development of the early Internet. For this project, I am using a mix of qualitative and computational methods.  I am also interested in this kind of mixed-method approach to qualitative data, both critically and in practice.  Outside of research, I like to run.

</p><h3><b>Before Michigan:</b></h3></center>
<div class="paragraph">
	I graduated from Barnard College in 2019 with a B.A. in physics and a minor in computer science. After Barnard and before starting my Ph.D., I spent <a href="https://tumblr.amnh.org/post/189970103984/meet-one-of-the-museums-helen-fellows-meera/"> two years </a> at the American Museum of Natural History in New York as a computational research fellow, where I worked on an applied machine learning project improving short term prediction of small-scale ocean current features. At the museum, I also taught introductory coding and oceanography to two groups of incredible high school students.
