</p><h2><b>About me:</b></h2>
</center>
<div class="paragraph">
	I am a third year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Information at the University of Michigan where I am advised by <a href="https://azjacobs.com/">Abigail Jacobs</a> and <a href="https://dallascard.github.io//">Dallas Card</a>.   I am an affiliate of the <a href="https://esc.umich.edu/">Center for Ethics, Society, and Computing</a>.
	Broadly, I am interested in the responsible development and use of natural language processing systems. You can view my CV <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ehufisdwsldcghobp7l7q/M-desai-2023.pdf?rlkey=lbueqn3wivio5el6m6vsmpdjd&dl=0">here</a>, follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/MeeraDesai18">@MeeraDesai18</a>, or <a href="mailto:madesai@umich.edu">email me</a> at madesai [at] umich [dot] edu. 
<p>
	Recently, I am particularly interested in supporting responsible practices for data curation and use of language models.  
	Some questions I am thinking about: Where do current approaches to measuring harmful language and informed consent in pretraining data curation fall short? How can we improve these measures and practices? How does pretraining data impact model evaluation, and what kind of data documentation could improve robustness in downstream use of language models?  Where are researchers going wrong (and right) when using language models for quantitative measurement?

</p><h3><b>Before Michigan:</b></h3></center>
<div class="paragraph">
	I graduated from Barnard College in 2019 with a B.A. in physics and a minor in computer science. After Barnard and before starting my Ph.D., I spent <a href="https://tumblr.amnh.org/post/189970103984/meet-one-of-the-museums-helen-fellows-meera/"> two years</a> at the American Museum of Natural History in New York as a computational research fellow, where I worked on an applied machine learning project improving short term prediction of small-scale ocean current features. At the museum, I also taught introductory coding and oceanography to two groups of incredible high school students.
